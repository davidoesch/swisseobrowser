# swissEO Browser `BETA`

A minimal, browser-only viewer for swisstopo's **swissEO** satellite products, modelled on the
[Copernicus Browser](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/) workflow.

**Live version: <https://swisstopo.github.io/topo-swisseobrowser/>**

> **Not for operational use.** This is an experimental beta prototype: values, renderings and statistics
> are computed in the browser, are not validated and may be wrong or incomplete. For authoritative data use
> the swisstopo products and services directly. The website was developed with the help of
> [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (Anthropic), an AI coding assistant. Every layer is being
> checked in depth; see [Layer verification](#layer-verification).

The whole application is a single file: [`swisseo-browser.html`](swisseo-browser.html). There is no
build step, no backend and no login. The page reads the swissEO Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and
the swisstopo WMS/WMTS services directly in the browser.

> **About the rest of this repository:** this repo started as a clone of
> [eu-cdse/copernicus-browser](https://github.com/eu-cdse/copernicus-browser). All files other than
> `swisseo-browser.html` (`src/`, `public/`, `package.json`, …) are the upstream Copernicus Browser
> sources. They are kept **only as a reference** for its user-interface behaviour and are not built,
> used or modified by the swissEO Browser. Changes are pushed to this repository only, never upstream.
> For the Copernicus Browser itself, see the [upstream README](https://github.com/eu-cdse/copernicus-browser#readme).

| WMS / WMTS | `wms.geo.admin.ch` (preset) and the external providers of map.geo.admin.ch ([`external-providers.json`](https://github.com/geoadmin/web-mapviewer/blob/3e5a2900/packages/mapviewer/src/modules/menu/components/advancedTools/ImportCatalogue/external-providers.json), read when the panel is opened), or any WMS / WMTS URL | Layers of other map services on the map and in the compare list |

The map runs in **EPSG:2056 (CH1903+ / LV95)**, the native CRS of the basemaps and the COGs, so nothing
is reprojected. It is drawn with [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/) and its custom projections
(`addProjection`, experimental, pinned to 6.16.0). MapLibre needs a power-of-two tile grid, which the swisstopo
WMTS levels are not, so the map has its own: tile 0/0/0 is a 512 px square at 2560 m/px with its top-left corner at
the swisstopo origin (2,420,000 / 1,350,000), so zoom 8 is exactly 10 m/px and every level lines up with the 10 m
pixel grid of the Sentinel-2 bands. The page draws every tile of this grid itself (custom `swisseo://` protocol):
the swisstopo WMTS tiles of the nearest level are composed into it, the swissEO layers are rendered from the COGs,
the VHI layers and external services are read by WMS or WMTS. At 20, 10, 5 and 2.5 m/px the swissEO layers are
pixel for pixel those of the swisstopo grid. The basemaps are composed from the swisstopo level nearest to the view's
resolution, each tile at that level's own pixel size, so only the GPU resamples them: at the resolution of a level the
map is shown 1:1 (pixel for pixel as before at 20, 5, 2, 1 and 0.5 m/px, within a sub-pixel shift at the others);
between the levels it is scaled, as any raster map in a continuously zooming viewer. The `zoom` of links stays the level of the swisstopo grid (see [URL parameters](#url-parameters)).

### Vegetation masks

The vegetation mask option (a pull-down) restricts every S2-SR layer, the AOI statistics, time series and
spectral explorer, and the analytical and print exports to forest or to all vegetation:

- **Forest / All vegetation (habitat map matching the date)**, the default choice: the versioned masks of the
  VHI processor ([topo-satromo-v2](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo-v2), `PRODUCT_VHI["vegetation_masks"]`),
  chosen by date as in `step1_processor_vhi.py`: habitat map v1-0 (2022, CLC+ 2021) before 2024-07-12, v1-1
  (2024, CLC+ 2023) before 2025-12-11, v1-2 (2025, CLC+ 2023) since. They are COGs on the swissEO 10 m grid at
  `https://s3-topo-satromo-prod.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/data/MASKS/Vegetation/{forest|vegetation}_mask_2056_habitatv1-…tif`
  (CORS enabled), *inside = value ≠ 0*.
- **A fixed version** (v1-0, v1-1 or v1-2, forest or all vegetation) for every date.
- **swissTLM3D forest**: the WMS layer `ch.swisstopo.swisstlm3d-wald` (Wald, Wald offen, Gebüschwald), drawn
  opaque, so *inside = alpha ≥ 128* of the GetMap image; the pixel inspector gives the class (GetFeatureInfo).

The two-date layers use the mask of the selected date on both dates, so a new mask version never shows up as a
change. The VHI season sums keep the forest mask of swissEO VHI v100 itself (see below).

### Scaling and no-data

Physical value = DN × scale + offset, as documented in the swisstopo *Additional Content Information*
sheets ([S2-SR v200](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/dam/en/sd-web/-i2Y10KmboPf/swissEO_S2-SR_AdditionalContentInfo_v200.pdf),
[VHI](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/dam/en/sd-web/vtF6jZqH7L4V/swissEO_VHI_AdditionalContentInfo.pdf),
[NDVIdiff](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/dam/en/sd-web/bODfHY8ioFyS/swissEO_NDVIdiff_AdditionalContentInfo.pdf),
[NDVIz](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/dam/en/sd-web/mZTj7kABmTrD/swissEO_NDVIz_AdditionalContentInfo.pdf)):

| Asset | Scale | Offset | No-data / codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B01–B12, B8A | 0.0001 | −0.1 | 0 |
| AOT | 0.001 | 0 | 0 |
| SCL | 1 | 0 | 0 (Sen2Cor classes 1–11) |
| Cloud mask (OmniCloudMask) | 1 | 0 | 0 clear · 1 thick cloud · 2 thin cloud · 3 cloud shadow |
| Terrain mask | 1 | 0 | 0–180 solar incidence angle (°) · 200 shadow · 255 no data |
| VHI | 1 | 0 | 0–100 index · 110 no data (class) · 255 no data (raster) |
| NDVIdiff (int16) | 0.001 | 0 | 32700 missing data (shown grey) · 32701 no data |
| NDVIz (int16) | 0.01 | 0 | 32700 missing data (shown grey) · 32701 no data |
| NDVIdiff v200 BETA (int16) | 0.001 | 0 | 32701 no data (values −2000…2000) |

**NDVIdiff / NDVIz overviews:** the internal overviews of these COGs average the missing-data code 32700
into valid values (e.g. 31630 or −9395 in the overviews, while the full resolution stays within
−0.8…0.65 ΔNDVI). The browser therefore treats overview values outside |ΔNDVI| ≤ 1 and |z| ≤ 20 as no
data; at full resolution (zoomed in, or AOI statistics on a grid finer than 14.8 m) every value is used,
and the statistics then match a rasterio read of the COG exactly. The overviews should be rebuilt with
32700 excluded (e.g. as an additional no-data value or a mask). The NDVIdiff v200 BETA COGs have clean
overviews (no-data handled when they were built) and need no such filter.

Indices (NDVI, NDWI, …) are computed from ρ after this scaling. Very dark pixels can fall slightly below
0 after the −0.1 offset; such negative reflectance is set to 0 before an index is computed, so ratio
indices stay within −1…1.

**Why indices are higher than in the Copernicus Browser:** since processing baseline 04.00 the Sentinel-2
L2A digital numbers contain a +1000 shift, which the offset −0.1 removes. The Copernicus Browser requests
its data with Sentinel Hub's `harmonizeValues`, which is numerically equivalent to leaving the offset out,
so its NDVI over dense vegetation is markedly lower (e.g. 0.56 instead of 0.87). CDSE confirmed that the
offset is correct and recommends keeping it
([forum thread](https://forum.dataspace.copernicus.eu/t/sentinel-2-baseline-04-00-offset-csde-stac-derived-ndvi-doesnt-match-copernicus-browser-ndvi/5417)).
The swissEO Browser therefore always uses the physical reflectance.

## Features

- **Layout as in the Copernicus Browser**: the menu on the left has the Confederation logo of map.geo.admin.ch
  ([ConfederationFullLogo.vue](https://github.com/geoadmin/web-mapviewer/blob/3e5a2900/packages/mapviewer/src/modules/menu/components/header/ConfederationFullLogo.vue)),
  the language (*EN* only for now), the collapse chevron and the title *swissEO Browser*; there is no header bar above the
  map. The chevron collapses the menu and a round button at the top left of the map opens it again; on small screens
  (up to 760 px) the menu starts collapsed and covers the map when opened. On the map:
  - top left: the date and the number of acquisitions on the map, the *Copy link* (chain) and *Pixel inspector* ((i) with a pointer) icon buttons;
  - top right: the place search, the **help button (i)**, below it the basemap switcher (the layer button) and the area
    of interest, image download, compare and timelapse buttons;
  - bottom right: the zoom buttons and, on one line, the mouse position (LV95 easting and northing, `E 2'661'150 N 1'187'175`)
    and the scale bar; bottom left: the attribution and the loading indicator.
- **Help and tutorial** ([`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html), opened by the (i) button in a new tab): an *About the
  swissEO Browser* overview with a beginner tutorial (Part A: window, place search, date, layers, pixel inspector, area of
  interest and statistics, download, sharing) and all functions in the order of the
  [Copernicus Browser documentation](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Applications/Browser.html) (Part B),
  with screenshots of the app in `docs/img/`. Deployed with the page.
- **Basemap switcher** as in the Copernicus Browser: the layer button at the top right opens (on hover) *Basemaps* (*Map* =
  pixelkarte-farbe, *SWISSIMAGE*, *Map Grey* = pixelkarte-grau, *None*) and *Map overlays* (*Labels*, always drawn above
  the data).
- **Labels**: the place, road, peak and lake names of swisstopo's base map vector tiles, in the style of swisstopo's imagery
  base map (white text with a dark halo), drawn by MapLibre as text: sharp at every scale and on high-DPI screens,
  without overlaps, and upright and facing the viewer in 3D. The tiles are in Web Mercator, so MapLibre's workers fetch the
  Web Mercator tiles under each tile of the map's grid, move the label features into LV95 and encode them again
  (`swisseo-vt://`); the zoom levels of the style are shifted by the difference between the two grids at the latitude of
  Switzerland (about 4.39). The names stop at the border of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The *Basic* image download
  takes them from the map; the high-res print and the timelapse, which are drawn away from the map, are without
  labels. The earlier ASIT VD label overlay was removed
  ([#6](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-swisseobrowser/issues/6)): swisstopo is not an ASIT member.
- **3D terrain** (the *3D* button below the timelapse button): drapes the map, the data layers, the label overlay and
  the area of interest over **swissALTIRegio**, swisstopo's 10 m terrain model, read from its COG and turned into
  terrain tiles of the map grid in the browser (at most 20 m per pixel, about 6 s for a first view). In 3D the map can
  be tilted and turned (right-drag or Ctrl+drag, two fingers on touch screens, the compass above the zoom buttons
  resets it); sky and haze appear towards the horizon, and the terrain beyond the basemaps takes the map's background
  colour. The split comparison needs the flat map, so 3D compares with opacity (switching 3D on turns a split into
  an opacity comparison; the highlights switch back to 2D). Statistics, analytical downloads, prints and the
  timelapse use the area around the centre of the view at its scale; the *Basic* download is the view as seen
  (without scale bar, an AOI crop clips all of it). The link keeps `3d`, `pitch` and `bearing`.
- **Place search** ("Go to Place", left of the basemap switcher, the width of the Copernicus Browser search field): the
  location search of map.geo.admin.ch, from two characters, results as you type (arrow keys and Enter work). A result
  zooms to its extent (municipality, district, canton) or to its point at the zoom of the result (1:25,000 when it has
  none, as on map.geo.admin.ch) and drops a pin; × clears the search and the pin. On small screens the field collapses
  to its magnifier icon.
- **Date selection as in Copernicus Browser**: a link without a date opens on the latest date with data;
  ‹ › jump to the previous / next date with data, the arrow button jumps to the latest one. The calendar,
  ‹ › and the grey "no data" date only consider acquisitions that **reach the map view**: the swath edge
  runs diagonally through each mosaic, so the data footprint of every relative orbit (`ORBIT_NR`) is read
  once from the coarsest B04 overview (≈ 640 m) and the calendar updates when the map moves.
  The calendar marks days with data, has month / year pull-downs and a maximum cloud-coverage slider
  (cloud cover of the whole mosaic, from its `metadata.json`, as the tile cloud cover in Copernicus). Several orbits acquired on the same day are mosaicked
  (most recent on top).
- **Configurations**: as the themes of the Copernicus Browser, the *Configuration* pull-down lists the
  layers for a task; each layer keeps its own data source, and the calendar shows the dates of the
  selected layer's source:
  - *Default*: composites (true color, false color, urban, SWIR, agriculture, geology), indices (NDVI,
    NDWI, moisture index, NDSI, NBR, AOT, **swissEO VHI** forest and vegetation, **swissEO NDVIdiff**),
    masks & quality (scene classification, cloud mask, terrain);
  - *Agriculture*: as the Copernicus Browser Agriculture theme, with the TCI as true color and without
    custom scripts: true color, false color, NDVI, EVI, Barren Soil, Moisture Stress, moisture index,
    agriculture, SAVI (colour steps and scripts of the Copernicus layers);
  - *Drought*: true color (TCI), NDVI, EVI, moisture index, swissEO VHI forest / vegetation, swissEO NDVIdiff,
    **swissEO NDVIdiff v200 BETA**, swissEO NDVIz, NDDI, NDDI change vs. the previous year and the NDVI difference to a reference date;
  - *Drought 2026*: like the Copernicus Browser *Drought and Floods* theme, with true color, moisture index,
    NDWI, Moisture Stress, NDVI, SWIR, urban and Highlight Optimized Natural Color, plus **highlights**;
  - *Forest*: true color (TCI), NDVI, EVI, swissEO VHI forest, **VHI cumulative deficit**, **VHI days in extreme
    stress**, swissEO NDVIdiff, swissEO NDVIdiff v200 BETA, swissEO NDVIz, NDVI difference to a reference date, Normalized Burn
    Ratio, moisture index and the **Forest Disturbance Classification**.
- **Highlights** (*Drought 2026*): story cards as in the Copernicus Browser (live thumbnail, title,
  dates, chevron). Clicking a card opens it on the map (the place at a fixed resolution and the TCI of the
  two dates as a split at 50 %, earlier date left, with a swipe handle) and the card turns blue; clicking
  another card switches. The chevron shows the text (English, at most ten lines), ending with *Show effects
  and advanced options*, which opens the compare settings. Choosing a layer leaves the highlight. Shared
  links reopen the highlight. Stories (defined in `CONFIGS.DROUGHT2026.highlights`: title, dates, layer,
  LV95 centre, m/px, text):

  The Tages-Anzeiger article on the same topic could not be read (paywall, archive not reachable).
- **Verification status**: every layer that has not yet been checked in depth carries the label **BETA** behind its name
  (in the layer list and the compare list), and its pull-down says that it still needs to be verified and that its values may
  be wrong; verified layers carry no label. See [Layer verification](#layer-verification).
- **Layers**: for S2-SR the true color, i.e. the **TCI** delivered with each mosaic (`tci_10m`, 8-bit RGB,
  JPEG / YCbCr) and shown as delivered (its internal mask decides what is data, so black pixels stay black),
  and the composites computed from the bands (false color, urban, SWIR, agriculture,
  geology 12-8-2, Barren Soil, Highlight Optimized Natural Color); NDVI, NDWI, moisture index, NDSI, NBR,
  AOT, EVI, SAVI, Moisture Stress, NDDI, Forest Disturbance Classification; scene classification, cloud mask,
  terrain / solar incidence.
  VHI: forest and vegetation (WMS), and the season sums VHI cumulative deficit and VHI days in extreme stress
  (from the daily forest COGs). Layers are listed with the Copernicus Browser preview thumbnails as icons.
- **Drought and forest layers**
  - *swissEO NDVIdiff* and *swissEO NDVIz* are read from their COGs with the colour ranges of the content
    information sheets (missing data grey). There are only three products per year (end of July, August,
    September), so the product **nearest to the selected date** is shown, also in compare, timelapse,
    statistics and exports; the date line names the product used.
  - *swissEO NDVIdiff v200 BETA*: beta data, not an official product. The year-on-year NDVI change of
    two-month **cloud-free mosaics** instead of single acquisitions. The mosaic
    ([main_cloudfree_mosaic_csde.py](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo-v2/blob/dev-20261006/main_functions/main_cloudfree_mosaic_csde.py))
    takes, per pixel and band (B02, B03, B04, B08), the first quartile of all observations of the window that
    are not cloud (mask 1–3), outside the footprint or in terrain shadow (200), as in the CDSE Sentinel-2
    quarterly mosaics; the windows are June/July, July/August and August/September
    ([util_reprocess_mosaic_csde.py](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo-v2/blob/dev-20261006/main_functions/util_reprocess_mosaic_csde.py)),
    named by their end date. NDVI from the mosaic reflectance minus the NDVI of the same window one year
    earlier ([test_reprocess_ndvidiff_csde.py](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo-v2/blob/dev-20261006/main_functions/test_reprocess_ndvidiff_csde.py)),
    clipped to forest. The window nearest to the selected date is shown; colours as swissEO NDVIdiff. Read
    with geotiff.js it matches a rasterio read exactly (test area near Aarau, 2026-08-31).
  - *NDDI* = (NDVI − NDWI) / (NDVI + NDWI), clipped to −1…1, with the palette of the
    [openEO drought notebook](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-community-examples/blob/main/python/50_thematic-notebooks/drought-nddi/drought-nddi.ipynb).
    By default the NDWI is computed from NIR and SWIR (B08, B11) as in
    [Gu et al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL029127). The notebook (Awesome Spectral Indices) uses an
    NDWI from green and NIR (B03, B08); it is selectable as *Green*, with a warning: NDVI + NDWI is then
    close to zero over vegetation and the index saturates. Test over Aarau, 2026-07-04, cloud-free pixels:

    | NDWI | inside −1…1 | median | at +1 (vegetation, NDVI > 0.5) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | green (notebook), with the −0.1 offset | 0.2 % | 19.5 | 86 % |
    | green (notebook), without the offset (DN / 10000) | 0.2 % | 23.2 | 100 % |
    | SWIR (Gu et al. 2007), with the offset | 74.5 % | 0.54 | 4 % |

    So the all-red map comes from the green NDWI, not from the reflectance offset.
  - *NDDI change vs. previous year*: NDDI of the date minus NDDI one year earlier (notebook palette,
    −1…1). The notebook compares May–July means of two years; here single dates are compared.
  - *VHI cumulative deficit* and *VHI days in extreme stress* (Forest): the
    two season indicators of the [Waldtrockenheit dashboard](https://waldtrockenheit-dashboard.vercel.app/vhi.html),
    which shows them per warning region, computed here **per pixel** from the daily swissEO VHI v100 forest
    COGs (10 m). For every day from 1 April to the selected day (at most 31 October), a VHI below 40
    (*stressed*) adds 40 − VHI to the deficit, and a VHI below 10 (*extremely stressed*) counts as a day in
    extreme stress (in total, not consecutively). Only days with a VHI value count (110 and 255 are
    skipped): after long cloudy periods the VHI is missing once its 7-day window has passed, so the deficit
    can be underestimated; the pixel inspector and the statistics give the number of days with data. Only
    pixels inside the forest mask of VHI v100 count (the mask of the most recent item; non-forest stays
    transparent): the overviews of the daily forest COGs of 2026-04-26 to 2026-05-08
    also hold values outside the forest (at 10 m their mask is the usual one), which would otherwise colour
    meadows and fields when zoomed out. The
    dashboard rates each region against its 2018–2025 climatology; per pixel this would need eight seasons
    of daily maps, so the deficit uses a fixed colour scale (0 to 2500, adjustable) and the extreme days the
    dashboard classes (0, 1–5, 6–15, 16–30, more than 30 days). The browser reads one COG per day: a
    regional view (6 tiles at 50 m) takes about 25 s the first time, a 2 × 2 km area at 10 m about 15 s.
    The sums are kept for the session, and a later day of the same season starts from those of an earlier
    one, so stepping forward through the dates or a timelapse only reads the days in between (31 August
    after 31 July: 4 s instead of 15 s; 27 weekly frames of a season at 480 px in 24 s). The AOI statistics
    show the histogram and the season curve (mean cumulative value over the area per day) instead of a
    time series. Checked against an independent rasterio read of the same 141 COGs (2 × 2 km near Aarau,
    1 April to 31 August 2026): the same sums of deficit, extreme days and days with data over all 40,000
    pixels, and the same values at the centre pixel (1509, 24 and 115).
  - *Forest Disturbance Classification*: the [Sentinel Hub custom script](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-2/forest_disturbance_classification/)
    by Jonas Viehweger and Martin Puhm (Joanneum Research, EvoLand project), run in the browser. A LightGBM
    model of 150 gradient-boosted trees classifies every pixel of a single date from B02, B05, B06, B8A, B11
    and B12 into bark beetle, clear cut, salvage logged (low confidence, same colour as clear cut), wildfire
    and windthrow; healthy forest is not drawn. Trained in Germany, Sweden and Spain (macro F1 0.83), valid
    only on forest, so the forest mask is on by default (clouds and cloud shadows are masked too). The trees
    (411 kB) are loaded on first use from jsDelivr, pinned to commit `0a071cf` of sentinel-hub/custom-scripts,
    and are only accepted when the code consists of tree functions alone. **Scaling:** the trees split on
    Sentinel Hub L2A digital numbers in the convention DN = 10000 × reflectance (data before processing
    baseline 04.00, e.g. the script's 2019 example), so the browser passes `max(0, DN − 1000)` of the swissEO
    bands, which equals 10000 × ρ. The port was checked against the original script (run in QuickJS): the same
    class for all 3000 test vectors. A 256 px tile takes about 0.2 s with the forest mask.
  - *NDVI difference to a reference date* (formerly *NDVI Analyst*): port of [RaffiBienz/ndvi_analyst](https://github.com/RaffiBienz/ndvi_analyst) (Canton of Aargau):
    ΔNDVI = NDVI(date) − NDVI(reference) (negative reflectance set to 0), forest mask by default, change =
    ΔNDVI below a threshold (default −0.08) followed by a 3 × 3 majority filter against edge effects.
    *Display*: the difference, or the detected change. The AOI statistics add the report of the original
    script: forest area, compared area and affected area in ha and %, with and without edge-effect removal.
    Both dates take, per pixel, the first clear scene (as the map). For a large AOI the report first uses a coarser
    grid (up to 320 cells across, read from the COG overviews) and warns that its shares can differ strongly from a
    10 m analysis; *Compute at 10 m* then processes the AOI at the full 10 m resolution in chunks of 1024 × 1024
    cells (exact areas and shares; checked against a rasterio computation). See
    [#5](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-swisseobrowser/issues/5): for the Canton of Aargau the 176 m grid gave
    13.7 % (13 Aug 2026) and 7.4 % (12 Sep 2026) after edge removal (VHI v100 forest mask), 10 m gives 11.1 % and
    11.7 % (habitat map v1-2 forest mask; 11.9 % and 12.3 % with the VHI v100 mask in an independent rasterio run).
  - Reference of the two-date layers: the acquisitions within ±20 days of the same day one year earlier
    (or of a chosen reference date, which goes first), clearest first; up to six days form a per-pixel
    composite, each pixel taking the first acquisition that covers it without clouds, so orbit gaps and
    clouds are filled. Clouds and cloud shadows are masked on both sides by default.
- **Layer list**: clicking a layer shows it (check mark). Clicking the active layer again hides it, so
  only the background map is shown (no check mark, a hint above the list); one more click shows it again.
  The layer menu (legend, masks, effects) opens and closes with the chevron; on start it is closed unless
  the link opens it.
- **Layer pull-down**
  - the Copernicus Browser title, description and "More info" link (Sentinel Hub custom-scripts page;
    swisstopo product page for True color L2A and the swissEO-specific layers); `</>` shows the formula
    and scaling;
  - legend with adjustable colour scale (min / max); NDSI is rendered as in the Copernicus Browser (snow
    above an adjustable threshold in blue, true color elsewhere);
  - for the TCI, **dark scene edges are removed** whenever the day has more than one scene (orbit), without an option:
    some orbits have a dark strip along one swath edge, which covers the other scene of the day in a mosaic. As in
    [main_cloudfree_mosaic.py](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo-v2/blob/main/main_functions/main_cloudfree_mosaic.py)
    (edge margin 200 px, brightness 40), pixels within 2 km of the scene's real footprint edge whose mean
    RGB is below 40 count as no data, plus one 10 m pixel around them against the JPEG ringing of the hard
    transition; the next scene fills them. The footprint comes from the TCI's internal mask at about 160 m;
    the edge zone is computed once per scene;
  - masks: clouds and cloud shadows (OmniCloudMask), terrain shadow (terrain mask 200), a vegetation
    mask (pull-down: off, forest or all vegetation of the habitat map matching the date or of a fixed version, or
    the swissTLM3D forest) and a **custom mask**: your own polygons
    (e.g. a forest map) loaded from a file or URL with the same import and limits as the area of interest;
    *Inside* keeps the data inside the polygons, *Outside* (inverted) the data outside. It works for every
    layer rendered from COGs (not the VHI WMS) and applies to the map, compare, AOI statistics, exports and
    the timelapse. After loading, the map zooms to the mask (a mask that comes with a shared link keeps the
    link's view). The layer pull-down shows the mask's file name, number of polygons and vertices, with
    *Replace* and *Remove*. A mask loaded from a URL is part of copied links, one from a file is not;
  - *effects and advanced options*: gain, gamma, red / green / blue ranges and opacity for all colour
    layers (for the TCI applied on top of the delivered image); for the composites computed from the bands
    also **Look**: *Standard* stretch or *True
    color optimized* (the tone curve of the Copernicus Browser True color layer: contrast enhancement with
    highlight compression, saturation 1.2, sRGB); gain, gamma, **adaptive gain** (lowers the gain when the
    view is bright (snow, glaciers, clouds) so that the 98th percentile of the reflectance stays just
    below saturation; never brightens, at most a factor of 4, recomputed when the view changes; not needed
    with the optimized look). Statistics, spectral explorer and pixel inspector use the reflectance bands
    also for true color; the inspector additionally shows the TCI value.
- **Compare**: add layers to the compare list; opening the Compare panel (or the ⇄ map button) shows
  them with a split or opacity effect, going back to Layers shows the single layer again. Reorder,
  remove and zoom to each entry (each titled with its layer name, prefixed by the data source only for
  the S2-SR layers). With the split effect a handle on the map swipes the top layer, with the
  date of each side next to it. **Each entry shows the date of the data it actually shows**, not the date it was added
  with: the nearest product for swissEO NDVIdiff, NDVIz and NDVIdiff v200 BETA (e.g. *2026-07-31* for a layer added on
  2026-08-13), the VHI day (the nearest one if the chosen day has none; also the end of the VHI season sums) or the
  S2-SR date (*no data* when there is none). The same date is used next to the swipe handle and in the image downloads.
- **WMS / WMTS** (button next to Compare in the configuration card, as the Copernicus Browser *WMS / WMTS* collection):
  - the swisstopo WMS (`https://wms.geo.admin.ch/?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities`, English titles) is
    preset and loaded when the panel opens; the pull-down above it lists the external providers of map.geo.admin.ch
    (`external-providers.json` of web-mapviewer, pinned to commit `3e5a2900`, fetched only when the panel is opened) and is
    searched by typing; **+** adds any other WMS or WMTS URL (a service URL or its GetCapabilities; without a
    type, `wmts` in the URL decides which protocol is tried first, then the other). The services you add are listed as
    buttons (with a delete button) and remembered in this browser;
  - the layers of the active service: search (*n of m layers*), pages of 10, 25, 50 or 100, a thumbnail (GetMap of the
    layer's extent within Switzerland, or one WMTS tile), title, abstract, attribution and *Metadata* links. A click shows
    the layer on the map instead of the swissEO layer (leaving the panel shows the swissEO layer again); the active layer
    has *Add to Compare* and a chevron that shows its legend, full description and opacity. Clicking the active layer
    again switches it off (the swissEO layer is shown again). The panel opens without an active layer (unless a link
    names one), and leaving it switches the external layer off;
  - drawing: from LV95 (EPSG:2056) when the service offers it, otherwise from LV03, Web Mercator, UTM 32N (EPSG:25832) or
    WGS84, placed on the LV95 tiles with an affine transform per 512 px tile (LV03 by the 2,000,000 / 1,000,000 m offset);
    WMS with one GetMap per tile, WMTS with the tiles of the tile matrix nearest to the resolution. Services that send no
    CORS headers cannot be shown: the map is drawn with WebGL, which only uses images sent with CORS headers (the status
    line and the layer's details say so);
  - permalink: `panel=wms` with `wmsUrl`, `wmsLayer` and `wmsOpacity`; external layers in the compare list keep their
    service URL, type and layer name in `compareLayers`.
- **Area of interest**: draw a rectangle (axis-aligned in LV95) or polygon, or import KML/KMZ, GPX, WKT,
  GeoJSON, a zipped Shapefile, an MGRS / GEOREF cell or a bounding box (WGS84, LV95 and LV03 coordinates
  are detected). Files can be uploaded or **loaded from a URL** (KML, KMZ, GPX, GeoJSON / JSON including API or
  WFS URLs returning GeoJSON, WKT, zipped Shapefile; the type comes from the extension, otherwise from
  the content; the server must allow cross-origin requests, CORS). **Sharing:** an area imported from a
  file or pasted is part of a copied link only when it is small (about 270 vertices; the link holds at
  most 8000 characters); the import dialog warns about this and the AOI bar shows *⚠ not in link*; an
  area loaded from a URL is shared as the URL (`aoiUrl`). Vertices stay editable (up to 2,000: drag a vertex, drag
  or click the middle of a side to add one, right-click a vertex to remove it; an edit or a new vertex that makes the
  outline cross itself is refused) and drawing again adds a polygon. The AOI is shown as an outline
  only; its toolbar copies the geometry, shows the area, centres the map and downloads the AOI as GeoJSON.
  For the area:
  - *Statistical info*: statistics and histogram for the selected date, and a time series over a date
    range (CSV download). The time series reads every date in the range (clouds are judged over the
    AOI itself, not by the cloud cover of the whole scene), least cloudy first (Stop keeps what has been
    read), and reports which dates were not reached by that day's orbit and which were fully masked. Clouds can additionally be excluded with the scene classification (SCL 3, 8, 9, 10),
    which catches clouds OmniCloudMask misses, and the area can be restricted to forest or to all
    vegetation (the share of valid pixels then refers to the masked area); a custom mask that is switched
    on for the layer restricts the area in the same way. VHI, NDVIdiff and NDVIz statistics are read from
    their COGs; the two-date layers report the difference (and the change
    report of the NDVI Analyst method) instead of a time series, the VHI season layers the season curve.
  - *Spectral explorer*: mean surface reflectance of all 12 bands (± σ), with CSV download.
- **Image download**: three tabs as in the Copernicus Browser:
  - *Basic*: the current view as PNG or JPG, with captions (datasource, date, scale bar) and an optional
    description, map overlays, legend, crop to AOI and an optional AOI outline; works in compare mode and in 3D.
    It is copied from the map as drawn (basemap, data layers and overlay one after the other), so it shows
    exactly what is on screen.
  - *Analytical*: any layers of the collection (visualised) and raw bands (B01–B12, B8A, AOT, SCL, cloud
    mask, terrain mask; VHI values) for the current view or the AOI, at LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH (40 / 20 /
    10 m) or a custom resolution, up to 2500 × 2500 px, as PNG, JPG or GeoTIFF (8-bit, 16-bit = stored DN,
    32-bit float = index or physical value) in CH1903+ / LV95, optionally with a dataMask band. Several
    files are zipped.
  - *High-res print*: the view re-rendered for a printed size, with the same captions, legend and AOI options,
    as PNG or JPG ([#2](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-swisseobrowser/issues/2)): width and height in cm,
    independent of each other, or a paper preset (A4 / A3, portrait / landscape), and DPI. *Scale*: *Fit*
    enlarges the view (or, with *Crop to AOI*, the area of interest) to the paper's aspect ratio, so it is always
    fully printed; a fixed scale (1:10 000 to 1:500 000) sets the extent to paper size × scale, centred on the
    area of interest (or the view), warns when the area does not fit (and gives the scale it needs) and adds the
    scale to the caption.
- **Timelapse**: as in the Copernicus Browser, for the current layer over the area of interest (data
  clipped to it, no outline drawn) or the current view:
  - time range, *Select 1 image per* orbit / day / week / month / year, month filter, Search;
  - **no hard limits**, e.g. one image per week over ten years. The search first reads the small scene
    metadata (about 4 kB each) and keeps only acquisitions whose orbit reaches the area (footprint per
    relative orbit); per week / month / year it then checks only the three clearest candidates (scene cloud
    cover) over the area. Example: Aletsch, weekly 2017 to 2026: 2,345 acquisitions, 1,304 checked, 505
    images in about two minutes. Above 600 checks or 300 frames the dialog warns that it takes a while
    and estimates the GIF size;
  - list of images with thumbnail (rendered only when the row scrolls into view), cloud cover and coverage
    of the timelapse area (AOI or view, computed from the cloud mask and the data footprint, not the cloud
    cover of the whole scene); per interval the image with the best coverage × clear sky is chosen; Max.
    cloud coverage and Min. tile coverage filter the list, images can be (de)selected;
  - frames are kept as JPEG (about 0.05 MB at 320 px, 0.2 to 0.5 MB at 1024 px instead of 4 MB of pixels)
    and decoded a few at a time, so hundreds of frames fit into memory;
  - preview player with speed (fps), transition None / Fade with fade duration, delay last frame,
    adaptive gain per frame for the band composites (snowy winter frames), legend and captions (date label,
    scale bar, source);
  - download as GIF or as video (MP4 or WebM, depending on the browser), default 1024 px (up to 2048).
    For long series a video is much smaller than a GIF (a GIF takes roughly 0.4 byte per pixel and frame);
    the video is recorded in real time, so 500 frames at 8 fps take about a minute. VHI layers work too
    (via the WMS; the VHI season layers from the COGs, which shows how the deficit builds up over a season).
- **Fast loading of the COGs**: JPEG tiles (the TCI) are decoded by the browser itself (about twice as
  fast as geotiff.js, off the main thread), decoded tiles are kept in a cache (up to 120 tiles), the map
  uses 512 px tiles like the COGs and keeps loading while panning, and a scene whose orbit misses a tile,
  or that the more recent scene already covers, is not read. Measured for the TCI of 2026-10-12: all tiles
  of a view in 1.0 to 1.5 s instead of 1.7 to 2.7 s.
- **Loading indicator**: at the bottom left, above the attribution, the number of tiles still rendering (or the basemap
  or terrain still loading) and of requests in flight; after 6 s of continuous loading it says that the connection is slow.
- **Pixel inspector**: the LV95 position, band values (DN and physical value), index value, SCL, cloud
  mask, terrain mask, forest / vegetation of the habitat map of the date (and of the layer's own mask) and the
  swissTLM3D forest class at a clicked location; for the two-date layers the index
  on both sides and the difference; for the Forest Disturbance Classification the class; for VHI,
  NDVIdiff, NDVIdiff v200 BETA and NDVIz the product value; for the VHI season layers the cumulative
  deficit, the days with VHI below 10 and the days with a VHI value.
- **Coordinates**: positions are LV95 (EPSG:2056) everywhere: the map centre in the permalink
  (`center=2703331.08,1133878.99`, as on map.geo.admin.ch), the mouse position at the bottom right, the compare entries,
  the pixel inspector, the area of interest in the link and the defaults of the import dialog. Links with the former `lat` / `lng`
  parameters open on the whole of Switzerland.
- **Permalink**: the URL is updated on every change (configuration, view, date, cloud filter, layer and
  whether it is shown, open layer menu,
  legend range, masks incl. the custom mask mode, look and effects, reference date, compare list including WMS / WMTS
  layers, the open WMS / WMTS service and layer, basemap and label overlay, AOI, 3D with tilt and direction); the *Copy link* icon (chain) at the top left of the map
  copies it. Areas and custom masks loaded from a URL are shared as that URL;
  areas imported from a file only when they are small, masks from a file never.
- **Feedback and issues** (Info tab, end of the *not for operational use* notice), as in
  [topo-drought-briefing](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-drought-briefing): every message carries the **permalink of the
  current view** and a one-line summary of what is on the map (layer, id, date of its data, BETA; the compare list or the
  WMS / WMTS layer), so a sentence or two is enough. A local copy links to the same view on the public website.
  - *Feedback*: an e-mail to david.oesch@swisstopo.ch and joan.sturm@swisstopo.ch, in the mail app, Gmail or Outlook Web;
  - *Report an issue / improvement*: a new GitHub issue in this repository whose title and text the viewer writes
    (URL parameters `title` and `body`), with the permalink, the layer and, for problems, the browser already in it, and
    the choices as tick boxes: *Fix or change a layer*, *Change a text or translation*, *Report a general problem*,
    *Suggest an improvement*. The same four kinds are issue forms ([`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)) for
    issues opened directly on GitHub, each with a required permalink field. Pre-filling the form fields from the URL
    did not work, hence the text; for it blank issues have to stay enabled (`config.yml`). Issues need a GitHub account,
    and *Issues* must be switched on in the repository settings.
- **Info tab**: the *not for operational use* notice (with the meaning of the BETA label, Feedback and issue links), the
  acquisitions of the selected date with their metadata, the scaling / no-data table, a description of the services used and links to all
  repositories and libraries the website builds on.
- Colours follow the Swiss Confederation scheme used by
  [swisstopo/topo-drought-briefing](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-drought-briefing).

## Layer verification

The layers are being checked one by one, in depth: data access (assets, dates, nearest product), scaling and
no-data, the formula and its source, masks, rendering and legend, statistics and exports, compared with
reference implementations where possible (GDAL / rasterio reads of the COGs, the original scripts). Until a
layer has passed this check it carries the label **BETA** behind its name, and its description and the Info tab say
that it still needs to be verified; a verified layer carries no label.

**This checklist is the source of the BETA labels.** Tick a box (`[x]`) to remove the label of a layer when it is verified and push: the
Pages workflow reads the list between the two markers below on every deploy (also when only this README
changed) and writes the checked layer ids into the published page. The workflow warns when a layer of the
page is missing here or an id here is unknown. A local copy of `swisseo-browser.html` reads this README itself:
the copy next to the page when it is served from the repository, otherwise (e.g. opened as a file) the README of
`main` on GitHub.

### Limits of the browser

Everything runs in the browser, so very large inputs are refused instead of freezing the page. Measured in
Firefox on a laptop:

| Input | Limit | Measured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File size (upload or URL) | 50 MB | a 27.6 MB GeoJSON with 1,000,000 vertices is read and reprojected in 0.5 s (plus download time) |
| Area of interest | 100,000 vertices | 99,000 vertices: drawn in 2.5 s, rasterised for statistics in 0.2 s |
| Vertex editing of the AOI | 2,000 vertices | one edit handle per vertex; above this the area is shown without handles |
| Custom mask | 1,000,000 vertices | 20,000 polygons: 3 ms per 256 px tile at 10 m, 70–90 ms per tile when the whole country is in view |
| Area in a copied link | about 270 vertices | the geometry is written into the link only below 8000 characters; URL-loaded areas and masks are shared as their URL |

## Running it

Use the live version at <https://swisstopo.github.io/topo-swisseobrowser/>, or run it locally by serving the
folder with any static web server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/swisseo-browser.html
```

A current desktop browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge) is required.

Conventions for further development (for people and for Claude Code) are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md):
no em-dashes in any text, LV95 coordinates, pushes only to this repository, how to add a layer.

### Deployment

GitHub Pages is published by the workflow [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml)
on every push to `main` that changes `swisseo-browser.html` or `README.md`, and can be started manually from
the *Actions* tab. On every deploy it applies the [layer verification](#layer-verification) checklist of this
README to the page. It deploys only `swisseo-browser.html`, as `index.html` (and under its own name), plus
the layer thumbnails it references from `public/previews/`, so the upstream `index.html` and sources are
never published. The repository's *Settings → Pages → Source* must be set to **GitHub Actions**.

External libraries are loaded from CDNs: MapLibre GL JS (an ES module, so the page script is a module too),
proj4js (also in MapLibre's workers, which tile the area of interest) and geotiff.js; the labels load pbf,
@mapbox/vector-tile and @maplibre/vt-pbf into MapLibre's workers, the import formats load togeojson, JSZip, shpjs
and mgrs on demand, and the timelapse GIF export loads gifenc.

## URL parameters

Parameter names follow the Copernicus Browser where an equivalent exists.

| Parameter | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `center` | `2703331.08,1133878.99` | Map centre in LV95 (E,N), as on map.geo.admin.ch |
| `zoom` | `17` | Zoom level of the swisstopo LV95 grid (8 to 27; about 17 to 18 for a region; fractional values give resolutions between the grid levels, interpolated in scale; written with three decimals) |
| `3d`, `pitch`, `bearing` | `true`, `60`, `160` | 3D terrain mode, with the tilt (0–75°) and the direction of view (degrees from north) |
| `fromTime`, `toTime` | `2026-10-05T00:00:00.000Z` | Selected date |
| `cloudCoverage` | `30` | Maximum cloud coverage in % |
| `layerMenu` | `open` | The menu of the active layer is open (default: closed) |

## Limitations

- Not available compared with the Copernicus Browser: pins, product search and download, custom
  scripts, other satellite collections, sharing timelapses through a server; the image download has no
  OSM background and no choice of coordinate system (always LV95). The 3D mode has no height exaggeration,
  no split comparison and no 3D timelapse.
- The map needs WebGL. Its custom projection API is experimental in MapLibre, so the page pins MapLibre 6.16.0.
- The VHI forest and vegetation layers are rendered by the WMS with its published styling, so their colour scale cannot be changed.
- The VHI season layers sum only the days with a VHI value, so long cloudy periods lead to an underestimated
  deficit; they read one COG per day, so the first view of a season takes a while, and they are not
  rated against a climatology as in the Waldtrockenheit dashboard.
- NDVIdiff / NDVIz: see the note on their overviews above; zoomed out, implausible overview pixels are left out.
- NDDI and NDDI change compare single acquisitions, not the May–July means of the openEO notebook. With the
  notebook's green NDWI the NDDI saturates (see above); the default SWIR NDWI does not.
- The Forest Disturbance Classification is a single-date model trained outside Switzerland; expect
  misclassifications, use it on forest only and validate the results.
- The NDVI difference to a reference date layer (NDVI Analyst method) works on the swissEO S2-SR mosaics instead of the original script's own Sentinel-2
  processing; AOI reports use a grid of at least 10 m (coarser for large areas, which the report states); its
  change report can be computed at 10 m for any AOI size.
- Statistics, time series, analytical downloads and high-res prints read the COGs in the browser; large
  areas, long date ranges and large prints take a while. Imports and custom masks have size limits (see
  *Limits of the browser*); areas and masks from files are not shared through links.
- swissEO NDVIdiff v200 BETA is beta data from example files outside STAC; its list of windows is fixed in the page.
- WMS / WMTS: only services that allow cross-origin requests (CORS) can be read, and only over HTTPS; layers that the
  service offers in none of LV95, LV03, Web Mercator, UTM 32N and WGS84 cannot be shown. Layers not in LV95 are placed on
  the LV95 grid per tile (accurate to about a pixel), not reprojected per pixel. Services whose images come without
  CORS headers cannot be shown at all (WebGL); the timelapse, statistics and pixel inspector only work with the swissEO layers.
  Only the default style and the default time of a layer are used.
- The language is English only (the *EN* pull-down has no other language yet).
